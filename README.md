##1st Approach
make a big array contains 784 dicts of 10 elements. 
For example, array[0] = {1: 0.3, 2:0.2, 3:0.6...} meaning that group 1 has center point at 0.3 for the front pixel. ...
This method is revoked because we cannot explain the relationships between each dimension and between each pixel.
